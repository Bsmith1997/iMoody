        <h6>
Setting: Sherbrooke and University Intersection
        </h6>
        <p>
Of the masses of people walking to class, there is one person that is looking straight down at their phone while walking with no sense of surroundings and walks 100 meters before lifting up their head to see another person almost walk into them. The person was holding the phone sideways so it was likely that he was watching a video.
        </p> 
        <br>
        <h6>
Setting: Trottier 5th Floor
        </h6> 
        <p>
A girl spends 20-30 minutes on her computer mindlessly looking at Facebook posts. It looks like she wants to do an assignment or study because there are notes in front of her but it seems she got distracted and wasn’t able to get anything done. 
        </p> 
        <br>
        <h6>
Setting: Trottier Cafeteria
        </h6>
        <p>
Two friends are eating lunch together, sitting across from each other. One of them is on their laptop browsing Reddit looking for an entertaining thread while the other is trying to spark a conversation. The friend browsing Reddit engages in the conversation for a little bit but then finds a topic about sports he found on Reddit and decides to read that. The other friend now takes out his phone and instinctively opens social media and the conversation dies. 
      </p> 
      <br> <br>
      <p><center><font size="4"><b>Problem Description</b></font></center></p> <br>
      <p>
        From our observations, we were able to draw some conclusions about the problems associated with Internet usage. Almost everyone has access to the Internet, whether it is through a phone or computer and the various resources on the Internet could be explored for countless hours if not monitored. This also takes away from socializing, as people can just turn to the Internet when they are at a loss for things to do. A study from the Industrial Psychiatry Journal concluded similar results with people who had high levels of activity on the internet experiencing negative drawbacks, whether it was talking less to friends and family or developing depression [1]. With respect to social media, the problem develops more seriously as there are more emotions at play due to the person having an online presence. For some people, that online presence is very important, which then leads into an addiction. This is not due to entertainment, but rather due to self esteem. From recently published research, it has been shown that addiction to Facebook is positively associated with depression, anxiety, and insomnia [2]. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The convenience of getting near instant entertainment or information out of a device is definitely something that can’t be downplayed. Being able to instantly message or email someone that could be across the country is only one of the many possible features that the internet offers us today that simplify our everday tasks. However, when these features become used for more entertainment purposes, such as watching a video or playing a game, instead of productive purposes then an addiction could be arise. Using these devices when needed is the goal, as their convenience becomes detrimental when it becomes too excessive or personal.

<p><center><font size="4"><b>Developing Personas</b></font></center></p>

        <p><b><u>Rationale</u></b></p>
        <p>To develop our personas, we followed the method outlined in Chapter 4 of Mental Models, "Define Task-Based Audience Segments". 
          <ol>
            <li>We started by listing distinguishing tasks, due to the relatively short amount of time we had to do observations, we also added in some characteristic behaviours that we have seen in friends and family with respect to social media and electronic device usage. </li>
            <br>
            <table>
              <tr>
                <th>Observations</th>
                <th> </th>
                <th> </th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Starting to study but being distracted by Facebook</td>
                <td>Sitting with friends but avoiding conversation and instead scrolling through Instagram</td>
                <td>Sitting with friends and trying to engage in conversation but they're all on their devices</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Wasting 3 hours endlessly scrolling through Reddit posts</td>
                <td>Taking your cell phone out as you wait for the traffic lights to change</td>
                <td>Repeatedly taking your phone out of your pocket without any reason, this seems to just be a habit for many people</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Going onto Facebook to check to see if your group member has messaged you about your project but getting distracted by your news feed and staying on for 1 hour</td>
                <td>Eating meals while on your laptop, browsing social media</td>
                <td>Taking a "five minute" study break but after opening Instagram it turns into a much longer break</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Always talking about how you're addcited to your devices but never making any changes to try to break bad habits</td>
                <td>Deleting Facebook for a while only to start using it again because you don't think you were as addicted as you thought</td>

                <td>Constantly comparing your life to the lives of Influencers you follow on social media </td>
                <td>Feeling like social media is your only chance at normal social interactions</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <br>
            <li>The next step was to group the task, this step is really where our personas started taking shape as we saw the more addictive traits fall under our "Avid User" persona and the traits that involved using social media as a coping mechanism fall under the "Reluctant User". </li>
            <br>
            <table>

            <br>
            <li>The third step was to name the groups or personas and we found that quite simple because our observations had quite a distinctive split between the "Avid user" and the "Reluctant user". </li>

        <p>Luna represents the avid phone user that we observed and have all seen in day to day life. She is never without an electronic device, either a phone, laptop or ipad and is constantly plugged into social media. She has notifications enabled for all her websites and appllications so as to never miss anything. She is always talking about how she should go on a technology detox but is consumed by FOMO. On average she spends 12-15 hours on her electronic devices. She is always comparing her life with those of the influencers she follows on social media. </p>

        <br>
         <div style="width:image width px; font-size:80%; text-align:center;"><img src="images/neville.jpg" alt="alternate text" width="300px" height="" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;"/> <br> Neville Longbottom: The Reluctant User</div> <br>
     
        <p>Neville has some mental health problems so has made efforts to cut back on social media usage. He struggles with stopping because he doesn't really think he has a social media addiction. He therefore sees no need to change. Social media is a tool for him to experience "normal life" because he struggles with leaving the house and interacting with people when he's having bad days. The internet and particularly social media provide escape for Neville. He believes that he's better off living vicariously through social media because he finds it easier to socialize when not face to face.</p> <br> <br>

         <div style="width:image width px; font-size:80%; text-align:center;"><img src="images/Luna_Destressed.jpg" alt="alternate text" width="300px" height="" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;"/> <br> Luna after a month of following the guidance of iMoody on destressing </div> <br> 

        <p>Luna decides that a technology detox is too difficult for her to do cold turkey so she installs the iMoody plugin on her Chrome browser. She then immediately visits Instagram to see what her high school friends are up to. Before she gets very far, iMoody pops up, asking her to rate her current mood on an emoji scale, which she does. She then spends another three hours on Instagram, which drastically reduces her mood as she comes across several posts by Kendall Jenner advertising Proactiv acne medication. Luna has always been insecure about her skin and the fact that such strong medication is often endorsed without any proper medical advice. She then sees a video featuring Shawn Mendes who says that he cured his ache simply by washing his face with water everyday. Feeling downhearted, she closes her Instagram window. iMoody again prompts her to rate her mood, which she does again. iMoody stores this information and suggests that she does a randomly selected mood boosting activity such as taking a walk to the nearest dog park. After Luna uses iMoody for a week she can view some statistics about how her social media use is negatively affecting her mood and can get some suggestions about easy steps she can take to change how she interacts with social media. This shows her that she doesn't need a technology detox to help her improve how she uses social media, she can instead take small, managable steps to help her cope with her addiction. </p> <br> <br>

         <p><u><b>Related Product #1</b></u>: MoodKit is a smartphone app designed for use with iOS 7.1 or later. It is based on the principal of using cognitive behavioural therapy to improve the mood, anxiety, and stress levels of the user.  The app contains four sections labelled, “Activities,” “Thoughts,” “Mood,” and “Journal.” Within these sections, the user can enter specific goals or thoughts, similar to the function of a diary. It is also possible for the user to select activities from a provided list that are suggested to improve moods. MoodKit’s other feature is that it will offer tips to the user on how they can improve their mood. </p>

         <p><i>Benefits:</i></p>
         <li> App is based on CBT, which is proven to be an effective method for improving moods. </li>
         <br> <br>
         <p><i>Drawbacks:</i></p>
         <p>
         <li>Not the most interesting application to use as it is very text based, rather than game-like.</li>
         <li>Due to all the different areas to enter information on the app, it requires significant personal motivation to use it. This is unlikely to contribute to the longevity of the app.</li>
         <li>It costs $4.99 on the Apple app store which may discourage users. </li> <br clear="all" />
         <li>MoodKit is not available to Android users.</li>
         </p> <br> <br> 
         <p><b><u>Related Product #2</u></b>: QuantiModo is a chrome browser extension that collects, aggregates, and analyzes data on symptoms, diet, sleep, exercise, medication etc. It then gives advice on how to maximize your health and happiness. It is also available as an app for iPhone and Android users. </p>
         <br>

         <p><i>Benefits:</i></p>
         <p>
         <li> Provides a central place to track your moods and medications rather than having all your information spread out across multiple applications. </li>
         <li>Is a browser extension, therefore the user doesn’t have to open an app every time they want to access the program. </li>
         </p> <br> <br>
         <br> 
         <p><i>Drawbacks:</i></p>
         <p>
         <li>Plugin is not very streamlined in execution. The reviews for the program show that there are still a lot of bugs. For example, the app allows you to schedule notifications, but the notifications do not consistently arrive for the user, which defies the point of the extension.</li>

         <center><b>Comparing Products</b></center></font></p> <br>
         <p><u><b>Related Product #1</b></u>: There are similarities between iMoody and MoodKit, in that they are both based around the idea of cognitive behavioural therapy, however there are several reasons as to why iMoody is the superior option for university students: </p>
         <p>
         <li>iMoody is designed to be simple and fast to use. While MoodKit offers a more journal like experience, iMoody offers a quick questionnaire to determine your mood and feelings, therefore it is a faster experience for the user and more suited to a busy student. </li>
         <li>iMoody is a chrome extension, so it is more convenient for students who are often at their computers. An app may seem easy, but the user would have to log on at several different time periods to track their mood on MoodKit, so iMoody offers a simple alternative.</li>
         <li>iMoody is a better option for lower income users as it is free to use, versus MoodKit which is $4.99 to download. </li>
         </p> 
         <br clear="all" /><br /> <br>
         <p><u><b>Related Product #2</b></u>: iMoody is a superior alternative to QuantiModo for use by university students. </p>
         <p>
         <li> It uses a different psychological approach. QuantiModo uses mindfulness, which is a therapeutic technique attained by purposely focusing on awareness of the present moment. iMoody uses cognitive behavioural therapy, which, unlike mindfulness, is a short term option for dealing with anxiety and mental health issues. The basic concept of CBT is that focusing on changing the way you think will change the way you behave. As our product is aiming at younger people addicted to technology, we feel like CBT is a better approach more suited to their needs. </li>
         <li> iMoody is a simple concept, so there will be less issues in the functionality of the extension unlike QuantiModo which has problems with bugs in the development. </li>
         <li> iMoody is better suited to already overwhelmed students, as it is only available as a chrome extension, unlike QuanitModo, which is available in several different forms. This will make it more simple for the user to add once to their computer, rather than having to download it across multiple platforms. </li>

        The extension will be primarily written in Javascript. Since we are not modifying any of the elements on the webpage we should only require use of a background script. This will then communicate with the iMoody API for calculating the suggestions based on the mood scores given by the user, which is TBD what type of technology it will be, and then we will have a database for storing the relevant data for giving suggestions for a user.

        <p>Our team consists of two software engineering students and one computer engineering student where each member's applicable skills are listed below: </p>
   
        <p><b>Lilith Smith</b>: Java, Python, CSS, JavaScript, HTML, Github, VueJS <br/>
        <b>Sam Cleland</b>: Java, Javascript, Python, AngularJS, VueJS<br/>
        <b>Babette Smith</b>:  Java, Java Swing, Java 2D, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Spring for web design, GitHub, VueJS, SQL </p>

        <p>The project that we’ve designed is achievable due to the wide range of skills our team possesses. Every member has web development experience, which we will be extending to develop a Chrome plugin. Working with plugins will be a new experience for all our members, which means we will be able to approach it with a new perspective but using pre-existing skills. </p>
      
        <p>Our team will split their tasks in order to best play to their strengths. Two members will develop the backend of the plugin while the other member will devote their time to developing a user interface. The design of the user interface for iMoody is vital as it will be what encourages users to interact with it, therefore all members will be involved in that portion of the project. </p>
      
        <p>The development of our plugin will be performed using Github as the version control system for the team. All members have experience using Github, so it will amplify the simplicity and smoothness of the development process. </p>
       
        <p>Our mission is to utilize the skills of each team member to their fullest while developing a plugin that will not only improve the mental health of the user, but will facilitate them moving forward with confidence in a technology centred world.</p>
      
        <p>In terms of time estimation, we are confident that 25 hours per team member will be sufficient for the development of iMoody.</p> <br>
