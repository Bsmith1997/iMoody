        <div class="caption text-left"><b>Luna Lovegood: The Avid User</b></div>
     
        <p>Luna represents the avid phone user that we observed and have all seen in day to day life. She is never without an electronic device, either a phone, laptop or ipad and is constantly plugged into social media. She has notifications enabled for all her websites and appllications so as to never miss anything. She is always talking about how she should go on a technology detox but is consumed by FOMO. On average she spends 12-15 hours on her electronic devices. She is always comparing her life with those of the influencers she follows on social media. </p>

        <div class="caption text-left"><b>Neville Longbottom: The Reluctant User</b></div>
     
        <p>Neville has some mental health problems so has made efforts to cut back on social media usage. He struggles with stopping because he doesn't really think he has a social media acciction so sees no need to change. Social media is a tool for him to experience "normal life" because he struggles with leaving the house and interacting with people when he's having bad days. The internet and particularly social media provide escape for Neville. He believes that he's better off living vicariously through social media because he finds it easier to socialize when not face to face.</p>

        <p><font size="4"><b>Justifying Feasibility</b></font></p>
        <p>Our team consists of two software engineering students and one computer engineering student where each member's applicable skills are listed below: </p>
   
        <p><b>Lilith Smith</b>: Java, Python, CSS, JavaScript, HTML, Github, VueJS <br/>
        <b>Sam Cleland</b>: Java, Javascript, Python, AngularJS, VueJS<br/>
        <b>Babette Smith</b>:  Java, Java Swing, Java 2D, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Spring for web design, GitHub, VueJS, SQL </p>

        <p>The project that we’ve designed is achievable due to the wide range of skills our team possesses. Every member has web development experience, which we will be extending to develop a Chrome plugin. Working with plugins will be a new experience for all our members, which means we will be able to approach it with a new perspective but using pre-existing skills. </p>
      
        <p>Our team will split their tasks in order to best play to their strengths. Two members will develop the backend of the plugin while the other member will devote their time to developing a user interface. The design of the user interface for iMoody is vital as it will be what encourages users to interact with it, therefore all members will be involved in that portion of the project. </p>
      
        <p>The development of our plugin will be performed using Github as the version control system for the team. All members have experience using Github, so it will amplify the simplicity and smoothness of the development process. </p>
       
        <p>Our mission is to utilize the skills of each team member to their fullest while developing a plugin that will not only improve the mental health of the user, but will facilitate them moving forward with confidence in a technology centred world.</p>
      
        <p>In terms of time estimation, we are confident that 25 hours per team member will be sufficient for the development of iMoody.</p>
