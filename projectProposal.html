          Observations
        </h4>
        <h6>
Setting, Sherbrooke and University Intersection
        </h6>
        <p>
Of the masses of people walking to class, there is one person that is looking straight down at their phone while walking with no sense of surroundings and walks 100 meters before lifting up their head to see another person almost walk into them. The person was holding the phone sideways so it was likely that he was watching a video.

Setting, Trottier 5th Floor
        </h6>
        <p>
A girl spent 20-30 minutes on her computer mindlessly looking at facebook posts, it looked like she wanted to do an assignment or study because there were notes infront of her but it seemed she got distracted and wasn’t able to get anything done.

        <p>
2 friends are eating lunch together, sitting across from each other. One of them is on their laptop browsing Reddit looking for an entertaining thread while the other is trying to spark a conversation. The friend browsing Reddit engages in the conversation for a little bit but then finds a topic about sports he found on reddit and decides to read that, so the other friend now takes out his phone and instinctively opens social media and the conversation dies.

      <h4>
        Problem Description
      </h4>
      <p>
        From our observations we were able to conclude the problems associated with internet usage. Almost everyone has access to the internet whether it is through a phone or computer and the various resources on the internet could be explored for countless hours if not monitored. This also takes away from socializing, as people can just turn to the internet when they are at a loss for things to do. A study from the industrial psychiatry journal had similar results with people having high levels of activity on the internet experienced negative drawbacks, whether it was talking less to friends or family or developing depression [1]. With respect to social media, the problem develops worse as there are more emotions at play because of the person having an online presence. For some people that online presence is very important, which then leads into an addiction not because of entertainment, but because of self esteem. From recently published research, it has been shown that addiction to Facebook is positively associated with depression, anxiety, and insomnia [2].

        The convenience of getting near instant entertainment or information out of a device is definitely something that can’t be downplayed. Being able to instantly message or email someone that could be across the country is only one of the many possible features that the internet offers us today that simplify our everday tasks. Using these devices when needed is the goal, as their convenience becomes detrimental when it becomes too excessive or personal.
