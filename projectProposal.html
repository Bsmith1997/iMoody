        <p>Our team consists of two software engineering students and one computer engineering student where each member's applicable skills are listed below: </p>
   
        <p><b>Lilith Smith</b>: Java, Python, CSS, JavaScript, HTML, Github, VueJS <br/>
        <b>Sam Cleland</b>: Java, Javascript, Python, AngularJS, VueJS<br/>
        <b>Babette Smith</b>:  Java, Java Swing, Java 2D, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Spring for web design, GitHub, VueJS, SQL </p>

        <p>The project that we’ve designed is achievable due to the wide range of skills our team possesses. Every member has web development experience, which we will be extending to develop a Chrome plugin. Working with plugins will be a new experience for all our members, which means we will be able to approach it with a new perspective but using pre-existing skills. </p>
      
        <p>Our team will split their tasks in order to best play to their strengths. Two members will develop the backend of the plugin while the other member will devote their time to developing a user interface. The design of the user interface for iMoody is vital as it will be what encourages users to interact with it, therefore all members will be involved in that portion of the project. </p>
      
        <p>The development of our plugin will be performed using Github as the version control system for the team. All members have experience using Github, so it will amplify the simplicity and smoothness of the development process. </p>
       
        <p>Our mission is to utilize the skills of each team member to their fullest while developing a plugin that will not only improve the mental health of the user, but will facilitate them moving forward with confidence in a technology centred world.</p>
      
        <p>In terms of time estimation, we are confident that 25 hours per team member will be sufficient for the development of iMoody.</p>
