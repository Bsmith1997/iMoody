         <p><u><b>Related Product #1</b></u>: MoodKit is a smartphone app designed for use with iOS 7.1 or later. It is based on the principal of using cognitive behavioural therapy to improve the mood, anxiety, and stress levels of the user.  The app contains four sections labelled, “Activities,” “Thoughts,” “Mood,” and “Journal.” Within these sections, the user can enter specific goals or thoughts, similar to the function of a diary. It is also possible for the user to select activities from a provided list that are suggested to improve moods. MoodKit’s other feature is that it will offer tips to the user on how they can improve their mood. </p>

         <p><i>Benefits:</i></p>
         <li> App is based on CBT, which is proven to be an effective method for improving moods. </li>
         <br> <br>
         <p><i>Drawbacks:</i></p>
         <p>
         <li>Not the most interesting application to use as it is very text based, rather than game-like.</li>
         <li>Due to all the different areas to enter information on the app, it requires significant personal motivation to use it. This is unlikely to contribute to the longevity of the app.</li>
         <li>It costs $4.99 on the Apple app store which may discourage users. </li>
         <li>MoodKit is not available to Android users.</li>
         </p> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
         <p><b><u>Related Product #2</u></b>: QuantiModo is a chrome browser extension that collects, aggregates, and analyzes data on symptoms, diet, sleep, exercise, medication etc. It then gives advice on how to maximize your health and happiness. It is also available as an app for iPhone and Android users. </p>

         <div style="width:image width px; font-size:80%; text-align:center;"><img src="images/QuantiModo.png" alt="alternate text" width="450px" height="" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;"/> <br> Available platforms offered by QuantiModo</div>
         <p><i>Benefits:</i></p>
         <p>
         <li> Provides a central place to track your moods and medications rather than having all your information spread out across multiple applications. </li>
         <li>Is a browser extension, therefore the user doesn’t have to open an app every time they want to access the program. </li>
         </p> <br> <br>
         <br> 
         <p><i>Drawbacks:</i></p>
         <p>
         <li>Plugin is not very streamlined in execution. The reviews for the program show that there are still a lot of bugs. For example, the app allows you to schedule notifications, but the notifications do not consistently arrive for the user, which defies the point of the extension.</li>

         <p><u><b>Related Product #1</b></u>: There are similarities between iMoody and MoodKit, in that they are both based around the idea of cognitive behavioural therapy, however there are several reasons as to why iMoody is the superior option for university students: </p>
         <p>
         <li>iMoody is designed to be simple and fast to use. While MoodKit offers a more journal like experience, iMoody offers a quick questionnaire to determine your mood and feelings, therefore it is a faster experience for the user and more suited to a busy student. </li>
         <li>iMoody is a chrome extension, so it is more convenient for students who are often at their computers. An app may seem easy, but the user would have to log on at several different time periods to track their mood on MoodKit, so iMoody offers a simple alternative.</li>
         <li>iMoody is a better option for lower income users as it is free to use, versus MoodKit which is $4.99 to download. </li>
         </p>

         <p><u><b>Related Product #2</b></u>: iMoody is a superior alternative to QuantiModo for use by university students. </p>
         <p>
         <li> It uses a different psychological approach. QuantiModo uses mindfulness, which is a therapeutic technique attained by purposely focusing on awareness of the present moment. iMoody uses cognitive behavioural therapy, which, unlike mindfulness, is a short term option for dealing with anxiety and mental health issues. The basic concept of CBT is that focusing on changing the way you think will change the way you behave. As our product is aiming at younger people addicted to technology, we feel like CBT is a better approach more suited to their needs. </li>
         <li> iMoody is a simple concept, so there will be less issues in the functionality of the extension unlike QuantiModo which has problems with bugs in the development. </li>
         <li> iMoody is better suited to already overwhelmed students, as it is only available as a chrome extension, unlike QuanitModo, which is available in several different forms. This will make it more simple for the user to add once to their computer, rather than having to download it across multiple platforms. </li>
