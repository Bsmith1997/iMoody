Of the masses of people walking to class, there is one person that is looking straight down at their phone while walking with no sense of surroundings and walks 100 meters before lifting up their head to see another person almost walk into them. The person was holding the phone sideways so it was likely that he was watching a video.

A girl spent 20-30 minutes on her computer mindlessly looking at facebook posts, it looked like she wanted to do an assignment or study because there were notes infront of her but it seemed she got distracted and wasn’t able to get anything done.

2 friends are eating lunch together, sitting across from each other. One of them is on their laptop browsing Reddit looking for an entertaining thread while the other is trying to spark a conversation. The friend browsing Reddit engages in the conversation for a little bit but then finds a topic about sports he found on reddit and decides to read that, so the other friend now takes out his phone and instinctively opens social media and the conversation dies.
