         <p><b>The problem description (Taken from the Project Proposal) </b></p>
           <p>
        From our observations, we were able to draw some conclusions about the problems associated with Internet usage. Almost everyone has access to the Internet, whether it is through a phone or computer and the various resources on the Internet could be explored for countless hours if not monitored. This also takes away from socializing, as people can just turn to the Internet when they are at a loss for things to do. A study from the Industrial Psychiatry Journal concluded similar results with people who had high levels of activity on the internet experiencing negative drawbacks, whether it was talking less to friends and family or developing depression [1]. With respect to social media, the problem develops more seriously as there are more emotions at play due to the person having an online presence. For some people, that online presence is very important, which then leads into an addiction. This is not due to entertainment, but rather due to self esteem. From recently published research, it has been shown that addiction to Facebook is positively associated with depression, anxiety, and insomnia [2].

        The convenience of getting near instant entertainment or information out of a device is definitely something that can’t be downplayed. Being able to instantly message or email someone that could be across the country is only one of the many possible features that the internet offers us today that simplify our everday tasks. However, when these features become used for more entertainment purposes, such as watching a video or playing a game, instead of productive purposes then an addiction could be arise. Using these devices when needed is the goal, as their convenience becomes detrimental when it becomes too excessive or personal.
