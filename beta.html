         <b><p>1. Evolution #1: Implementation of Backend</p></b> 
         <p>The major change since the submission of the Alpha System was adding a functional backend to the system. This enhanced many features of iMoody, the most important of which are written below:</p> <br>

         <p>a) <p><i>Beta System:</i></p>

     	 <p>A user account can now be created on iMoody. This will allow a user to create an account, rate their mood, and logout. When the user returns to iMoody for future sessions, they will be able to log back into their account and continue their session. </p><br>

         <p><i>Previously Done for the Alpha System:</i></p>
         <p>In our Alpha System, this had not been implemented, so a new account had to be created for every session.</p><br>


         <p>b) <p><i>Beta System:</i></p> 

     	 <p>User moods can now be tracked over multiple sessions. For example, a user can log into iMoody and rate their mood, use Instagram for a while, then rate their mood again and log out. The next day, the user can do the same thing, then look at their Mood History. This history will display their mood for the current day, as well as the previous day. </p><br>


         <p><i>Previously Done for the Alpha System:</i></p>
         <p>In our Alpha System, the mood history would only showup for one session at a time. As soon as the user logged out, the history would be forgotten.</p> <br>


         <p><i>Motivation for Evolution #1:</i></p>
         <p>Implementing the backend has allowed us to improve the iMoody experience for users as they are now able to create an account and track their moods. We believe this will aid users in using iMoody as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. In users making a conscious decision to monitior their moods, they will become more aware of their Internet usage.</p> <br>


         <b><p>2. Evolution #2: Implementation of Backend</p></b> 

         <p><i>Beta System:</i></p> 
         <p>We updated the format of the mood history page to include a current mood over time, a previous mood, and the average mood. This can be seen in Figure 1 below. The benefit of these additions will be allowing users to have more constant feedback on their moods. The "Current Mood," represents the current mood of the user. The "Previous Mood," represents the mood of the user during their last session on iMoody. The "Average Mood," shows users what their average mood has been over multiple sessions. </p>

         <div style="width:image width px; font-size:80%; text-align:center;"><img src="images/Beta/Current.jpeg" alt="alternate text" width="300px" height="" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;"/> <br> Figure 1: Updated iMoody Mood History for Beta System</div> <br> <br>

         <p><i>Previously Done for the Alpha System:</i></p>
         <p>Our Alpha System did show a user's mood over time, as seen in Figure 2 below. However, no other moods were displayed. Therefore iMoody was not giving users motivation to change their Internet habits because they could not visualize the full extent of Internet usage on their mood.</p>

         <div style="width:image width px; font-size:80%; text-align:center;"><img src="images/Beta/Previous.png" alt="alternate text" width="300px" height="" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;"/> <br> Figure 2: Previous Implementation of iMoody Mood History for Alpha System</div> <br>

         <p><i>Motivation for Evolution #2:</i></p>
         <p>Our aim here is to trigger users into realizing that Internet usage has a negative affect on their mood by seeing their moods compared side by side. With the addition of past and average moods, we believe this will help users in becoming more conscious of their actions and empower them to take time away from their devices.</p> <br>

         <b><p>3. Evolution #3: Addition of an iMoody Icon</p></b> 

         <p><i>Beta System:</i></p>
         <p>Our icon has been changed to be the shape of an eye, enclosed by a black box. The eye is to represent the "i" in iMoody. Within the eye, we have added a pink square to represent the iris. We decided on making it square instead of circular to pay homage to the old myth of, “Don’t watch too much TV! Your eyes will go square!” While this is not true, it does represent that we are all aware that being glued to our devices is not great for our health, whether this be mentally or physically. Our new icon can be seen in the Chrome browser below (Figure 3), and an enlarged image below that (Figure 4). </p> <br>

         <div style="width:image width px; font-size:80%; text-align:center;"><img src="images/Beta/UpdatedIcon.jpeg" alt="alternate text" width="1000px" height="" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;"/> <br> Figure 3: Updated iMoody Icon in Chrome Browser</div> <br>

         <div style="width:image width px; font-size:80%; text-align:center;"><img src="images/Beta/iMoodyIcon.png" alt="alternate text" width="300px" height="" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;"/> <br> Figure 4: Final iMoody Icon </div> <br><br>

         <p><i>Previously Done for the Alpha System:</i></p>
         <p>iMoody had previously been represented by a white, lowercase "i", against a grey background (Figure 5). We found that users did not particularly like this icon, and were not aware that is was meant to be iMoody's.</p>

         <div style="width:image width px; font-size:80%; text-align:center;"><img src="images/Beta/PreviousIcon.png" alt="alternate text" width="1000px" height="" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;"/> <br> Figure 5: Previous iMoody Icon in Chrome Browser</div> <br>


	     <p><i>Motivation for Evolution #3:</i></p>
	     <p>Our reasons for changing the design of the iMoody icon were to make it something more visible, easily connected to iMoody, and aesthetically pleasing. </p> <br>

         <p><center><font size="4"><b>Prototype Revisions</b></font></center></p>
         <p>The updated version of iMoody can be downloaded at: <a href = "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/imoody"> iMoody - Chrome Web Store. </a>It is necessary to run this pop up on a Chrome browser.</p><br>

         <p><b>The problem description (Taken from the Project Proposal) </b></p>
           <p>
        From our observations, we were able to draw some conclusions about the problems associated with Internet usage. Almost everyone has access to the Internet, whether it is through a phone or computer and the various resources on the Internet could be explored for countless hours if not monitored. This also takes away from socializing, as people can just turn to the Internet when they are at a loss for things to do. A study from the Industrial Psychiatry Journal concluded similar results with people who had high levels of activity on the internet experiencing negative drawbacks, whether it was talking less to friends and family or developing depression [1]. With respect to social media, the problem develops more seriously as there are more emotions at play due to the person having an online presence. For some people, that online presence is very important, which then leads into an addiction. This is not due to entertainment, but rather due to self esteem. From recently published research, it has been shown that addiction to Facebook is positively associated with depression, anxiety, and insomnia [2]. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The convenience of getting near instant entertainment or information out of a device is definitely something that can’t be downplayed. Being able to instantly message or email someone that could be across the country is only one of the many possible features that the internet offers us today that simplify our everday tasks. However, when these features become used for more entertainment purposes, such as watching a video or playing a game, instead of productive purposes then an addiction could be arise. Using these devices when needed is the goal, as their convenience becomes detrimental when it becomes too excessive or personal.
