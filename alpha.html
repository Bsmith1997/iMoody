         <b><p>1. Usability Issue #1: Troubles With Installation</p></b> <br>
         <p>One of the major issues we encountered with test users was the lack of guidance when it came to installing iMoody. Two things negatively contributing to this are outlined below, along with corrections we have made to improve this: </p>

            <p><i>a) An incomplete user manual</i></p>

            <p>Our previous user manual was incorrectly structured and focused on what tasks a user should perform, rather than how they should go about it. From the feedback provided in the Formative Feedback stage, we were able to understand how this is confusing for users and for this deliverable, we have added more detailed instructions focusing on the "how", rather than the "what". For example, instead of listing steps like, "Download App, Set Up Account, Rate Mood, etc.", we have created sections dedicated to each action possible within iMoody.</p> <br>


            <p><i>b) Our pop up had to be run through Github, which was challenging for test users who were not previously familiar with it. </i></p> 

            <p>This was an unexpected issue, as our team had not considered the downloading of the pop up through Github to be part of the user test. However, due to unclear instructions on our part, several test users struggled to use the app, as they were unsure of how to download it. This was important feedback for us to hear, as we learnt that assumptions should not be made about users, and clear instructions are vital to a well functioning app. </p>

            <p>Remediation steps for this issue involved both reworking our pop up, and rewriting the user manual. As far as our pop up is concerned, we no longer run iMoody through Github. Instead, it is downloaded as an Android extension which is a more familiar tool to most users. Our user manual has also been updated to reflect this change, providing more detailed instructions that will walk the user through the download process.</p> <br>

            <p>Both the issues mentioned above relate to <u> Nielson's Usability Goal #10: Help and Documentation </u>. Due to issues with our User Manual, users were not able to use the pop up easily, affecting the possible positive results they might otherwise experience. It also increased the average installation time to 121.4 seconds, which we had anticipated to be much less. This is why we have put a lot of emphasis on improving our User Manual in this iteration.</p> <br> <br>


          <b><p>2. Usability Issue #2: Redundant Window Popups</p></b> <br>

          <p>This was an issue we had not previously encountered throughout our testing, but was a problem for multiple test users in the Formative Feedback stage. When a user navigated through the iMoody steps we had laid out, they unwittingly opened up multiple iMoody windows. This was not only distracting to the user, but also unpleasant and cumbersome. Instead of providing a seemless transition from iMoody to social media and back again, it discouraged users from using iMoody in the future. </p>

          <p>In order to rectify this issue, we have altered our popup to function on only one window. For example, the user can start on the log in page, and from there navigate to rating their mood and seeing activity suggestions through the use of buttons on the screen. This provides a seamless and simple application, allowing the user to get the most benefit out of iMoody.</p> 

          <p>This issue relates to two of Nielson's goals. Firstly, <u> Goal #4 Consistency and Standards.</u> This goal is relative as having multiple pop up windows does not allow for a consistent user interface. <u>Goal #7 Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</u> is also an important goal to keep in mind here, as multiple pop ups could annoy a user and make the pop up difficult to navigate. By prioritizing this goal, we should see increasingly positive comments about the functionality of our pop up.<br> <br>  <br>

          <b><p>3. Usability Issue #3 and #4: Ambiguous Icons</p></b> <br>

          <p>Feedback from users showed that there were many issues stemming from confusion over icons. For example, users could understand how to create an account with iMoody, but there was no clear way to log back in upon returning to the pop up. This meant that most of the users would need to create a new account every time they used iMoody. It also meant that users were not able to see a mood display on the graph as they were considered new users by the system.</p>

          <p>We addressed this issue by altering the icons. As it was before.......</p>

          <p>The confusion with the log in button was related to <u>Nielson's Goal #5 Error Prevention</u> because the test users would accidentally create new accounts rather than logging back into their already created one. This would lead to frustration on the part of the user, and ultimately discourage them from using iMoody.</p>

          <p>Another related usability goal is <u>Nielson's Goal #2 Match Between System and the Real World.</u> Our previously used buttons..............</p> <br> <br>
