         <p><center><font size="4"><b>Design Evolution</b></font></center></p>
         <p>The tests that we conducted with our Low Fidelity Prototypes highlighted several points where we saw room for improvement. Below we have outlined the three major changes that our design has undergone since the last deliverable, as well as one change that we have yet to implement but plan to in the next design iteration.</p>

         <div class="list">
            <ol type="1">
               <li><b>Removed Confusing Symbols</b> <br>An issue that was apparent in our all tests and for all three prototypes was that the symbols that we had chosen to represent different things in the pop-up were either misleading or confusing. This lead us to relacing all the symbols we had with generic ones that people could easily identify and understand. </li><br><br>
               <li><b>Added a logout button</b> <br>This was something that was neglected in all three original prototypes and is an important function to allow the user to control their experience. The logout button is now easy to locate and gives the user autonomy about how and when they use the application.</li><br><br>   
               <li><b>Added the capability for users to select activity groups that they want to get recommendations about</b> <br>This improvement did exist in some of the prototypes, however, we decided to include it in the high fidelity prototype because it was well recieved in the testing period. This is a way for users to personalize their accounts by filtering the mood boosting activity recommendations they will have access to.</li><br><br> 
               <li><b>Add ability to allow users to add custom activities</b> <br>This improvement is one that we have not yet implemented, however, we believe that it will be a great addition for the next iteration. This will give the users the feeling that they can customize the pop-up as much as they can. At any point, the user will be able to go into their account preferences and add these custom choices into their mood boosting activity categories. </li><br><br> 
            </ol>

         <br>

         <center><font size="4"><b>User Population</b></font></center> <br>
         <p>As stated in our project proposal, the target user base for this pop-up is comprised of students who are attempting to break their social media addiction. This user base can include students with and without mental illnesses, the intention is that it will be a way to teach users how to interact with social media in a healthy way. The ideal test base would be people who believe they have a social media addiction so we can gauge how effective the users find using the pop up over a defined period of time. </p>
         <br>
         <center><font size="4"><b>Usability Goals</b></font></center> <br>

         <p>For this section, we decided to reuse the usability goals that we defined in the Low Fidelity Deliverable, they are outlined below: </p>
            <b>1. The registration process should be fast and easy:</b> The registration process for iMoody should take the user less than a minute. The system does not require a large amount of personal information, simply the name, and email address of the user as well as their interests so the recommendations are tailored well. This means it is fast to fill out in most cases.<br><br>
            <b>2. The system should be convenient to use:</b> The goal of iMoody is to be as non-intrusive as possible so as not to annoy users. We want iMoody to help the user learn new habits in terms of how they use social media, not annoy them so much that they ignore or delete the plugin. Therefore, the pop-up will only appear when user input is needed and can be found easily in the navigation bar.<br><br>
            <b>3. Rating mood should be done very quickly:</b> The user's most interaction with the iMoody will come in the form of the mood rating pop up. Because of this it is something that should be very fast so as not to take up the user's time. Users should be able to rate their mood within 15 seconds.<br><br>
            <b>4. The system should not hinder the user’s normal activities:</b> The iMoody system is not designed to cut the user off from using social media or limit the use of it. The point is to use cognitive behavioural therapy to help the user learn heathier habits in relation to social media. This means that the user can continue with their normal habits without interference from the pop up.<br><br>
            <b>5. The system’s interface should be simple to understand: </b> The system is designed to have a low learning curve so as to appeal to as many people as possible. New learners should not have significant difficulty getting to know the system especially as there are not many different windows to interact with.<br><br>
            <b>6. The system should help the user reduce the time spent on social media: </b> The system is designed to show the user the negative effect that excessive social media use has on their mood and give them tools to combat that. Because of this, iMoody should, over time, teach the user to spend more time off social media.<br><br>
            <b>7. The system should provide a visual representation for users to see how social media alters their mood: </b>An important part of the cognitive therapy approach that we are applying is being to show the user the results that their social media use has on their mood. This means that users should be able to access an easy to interpret visual representation of how their mood is affected by their usage.  <br><br>

         <p><center><font size="4"><b>Usability Test Procedure</b></font></center></p>

         <b>How many examiners are required?</b>
         <p>Ideally, there will be three examiners; one person to direct the testee through the process, one to film or record the session and one to take detailed notes. The minimum number of examiners would be two, one directing and one recording the session.</p><br>
         <b>What equipment will the examiners need?</b>
         <p>The examiners will need either a laptop or desktop with a Chrome browser installed. The device needs to be able to access the internet.</p><br>
         <b>How should your prototype be handled?</b>
         <p>The user will download and access the pop-up by following the provided user manual. After the user has downloaded the pop up, they should be able to continue without instructions. If the user encounters problems, the examiners should note this down and only provide a hint if the user is stuck and cannot continue the test.</p><br>
         <b>How will you instruct your examiners to proceed?</b>
         <p>The examiners should have tried to use the prototype in advance and should have familiarized themselves with the user manual and test procedures. Our recommendation is that the examiners perform the test themselves first so they can better answer user's questions.</p><br>
         <b>How should the examiners treat the test subjects, what should they tell them?</b>
         <p>The examiners should be respectful and professional whenever they interact with the test subjects. It is also important that examiners treat the information that test subjects share in a way that adheres to the consent form they signed. It is also important that the correct test procedure is followed, especially that the pre and post test questionnaires are completed at the correct times.</p><br>
         <b>What should the examiners avoid telling the test subjects?</b>
         <p>The examiners should not provide helpful hints when they see that the test subject is a bit confused, it is important that the test subjects try to work out how to fix the confusion alone before providing aid. It is also important that examiners remain impartial towards the product, their personal feelings about it should not be shared with subjects before or during the tests.</p><br>
         <b>What/how/when should the examiners measure?</b>
         <p>The examiners should measure success as test subjects completing the usability goals, this can be done throughout the test. The examiner who is taking notes on the test should fill in the data collection sheet to help with measurement.</p>
         <br>

         <center><font size="4"><b>Reporting</b></font></center><br>
         <p>With permission from the test subject, a video of the test session should be taken, or an audio recording if video is not possible. Notes should be taken as well, in case the examiner notices something at the time that might be missed in the video. The main points to notice for this section are: the steps that the user had difficulty with, any components that they particularly liked or disliked, and features or functionality that is missing.</p> 
         <p><b><u>Steps for Test:</u></b></p>
         <p>1. The test subject should fill in the pre-test questionnaire. <p>
         <p>2. The examiner should fill in the data collection sheet as the test progresses.<p>
         <p>3. The post-test questionnaire should be completed by the test subject at the end of the test. <p>
         <p> 4. If there are additional commenents that are not reflected in the video/audio recording and the data collection sheet, a short decription can be used to summarize these points. </p>

         <p><center><font size="4"><b>Usability Evaluation</b></font></center></p>
         <p>The usability goals that we are prioritizing are taken from "10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design" by Jakob Nielsen. We have selected the goals that we feel are the most important to our pop-up, however, this does not mean we want to ignore the other ones. We have therefore provided a ranking of the goals and a rationale for the selections.</p> 
         <p>To perform a heuristic evaluation that lines up with our prioritites, examiners should read the rationale that follows about our choices and evaluate if this achieved at each stage of the test.</p>
         <div class="list">
            <ol type="1">
               <li><b>User Control and Freedom</b> <br> This is the primary goal to us because we want iMoody to be a way for users to learn healthy habits. If they feel like they are in control of the system, it won't be something they will have to put much effort into learning. iMoody can complement the user's day to day routine. The user should feel like, at every time when using the pop-up, it is possible to undo or redo any action they have made and that it is simple to customize their accounts.</li><br><br><br><br><br>

               <li><b>Flexibility and effiency of use </b><br> The iMoody pop-up should cater effectively to both inexperienced and experienced users. iMoody is designed so as not to have a high learning curve when getting to know the system so users should quickly feel comfortable with it, it is also a goal to design iMoody in such a way that users can tailor frequent actions. This is part of the reason that we included customized recommendations based on selections that the user made when signing up. It is also our aim to allow users to add custom interests or activites, however, this was not achieved in the prototye and does not drastically alter the user experience.</b></li> <br><br><br><br><br><br>
               <li><b>Aesthetic and minimalist design: </b>This goal is a priority because our pop-up is intended to help users learn healthy habits and improve their mental health. A minimalist design will help with this because it will keep the user's space clean and calm when using iMoody. The asthetic we have chosen is designed to reinforce the Cognitive Behavioural Techniques (CBT) that iMoody was designed around. For example, the emoji scale that users will rank their mood with is a technique that is used in CBT because it is easier for users to relate to emojis instead of a sliding bar or a scale.</li> <br><br><br><br><br>

               <li><b>Visibility of system status</b></li><br>
