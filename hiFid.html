         <p>As stated in out project proposal, the target user base for this pop-up is comprised of students who are attempting to break their social media addiction. This user base can include students with and without mental illnesses, the intention that it will be a way to teach users how to interact with social media in a healthy way no matter what. The ideal test base would be people who believe they have an social media addiction so we can gauge how effective the users find using the pop up over a defined period of time. </p>
         <br>
         <center><font size="4"><b>Usability Goals</b></font></center>
         <p>For this section, we decided to reuse the usability goals that we defined in the Low Fidelity Deliverable, they are outlined below: </p>
            <b>1. The registration process should be fast and easy:</b> The registration process for iMoody should take the user less than a minute. The system does not require a large amount of personal information, simply the name, and email address of the user as well as their interests so the recommendations are tailored well. This means it is fast to fill out in most cases.<br><br>
            <b>2. The system should be convenient to use:</b> The goal of iMoody is to be as non-intrusive as possible so as not to annoy users. We want iMoody to help the user learn new habits in terms of how they use social media, not annoy them so much that they ignore or delete the plugin. Therefore, the pop-up will only appear when user input is needed and can be found easily in the navigation bar.<br><br>
            <b>3. Rating mood should be done very quickly:</b> The user's most interaction with the iMoody will come in the form of the mood rating pop up. Because of this it is something that should be very fast so as not to take up the user's time. Users should be able to rate their mood within 15 seconds.<br><br>
            <b>4. The system should not hinder the user’s normal activities:</b> The iMoody system is not designed to cut the user off from using social media or limit the use of it. The point is to use cognitive behavioural therapy to help the user learn heathier habits in relation to social media. This means that the user can continue with their normal habits without interference from the pop up.<br><br>
            <b>5. The system’s interface should be simple to understand: </b> The system is designed to have a low learning curve so as to appeal to as many people as possible. New learners should not have significant difficulty getting to know the system especially as there are not many different windows to interact with.<br><br>
            <b>6. The system should help the user reduce the time spent on social media: </b> The system is designed to show the user the negative effect that excessive social media use has on their mood and give them tools to combat that. Because of this, iMoody should, over time, teach the user to spend more time off social media.<br><br>
            <b>7. The system should provide a visual representation for users to see how social media alters their mood: </b>An important part of the cognitive therapy approach that we are applying is being to show the user the results that their social media use has on their mood. This means that users should be able to access an easy to interpret visual representation of how their mood is affected by their usage.  <br><br>

         <center><font size="4"><b>Usability Test Procedure</b></font></center>
         <b>How many examiners are required?</b>
         <p>Ideally there will be three examiners, one person to direct the testee through the process, one to film or record the session and one to take detailed notes. The minimum number of examiners would be 2, one directing and one recording the session.</p>
         <b>What equipment will the examiners need?</b>
         <p>The examiners will need either a laptop or desktop with a Chrome browser installed. The device needs to be able to access the internet.</p>
         <b>How should your prototype be handled?</b>
         <p>The user will download and access the pop-up by following the provided user manual. After the user has downloaded the pop up, they should be able to continue without instructions. If the user encounters problems, the examiners should note this down and only provide a hint if the user is stuck and cannot continue the test.</p>
         <b>How will you instruct your examiners to proceed?</b>
         <p>The examiners should have tried to used the prototype in advance and should have familiarized themselves with the user manual and test procedures. Our recommendation is that the examiners perform the test themselves first so they can better answer user's questions.</p>
         <b>How should the examiners treat the test subjects, what should they tell them?</b>
         <p>The examiners should be respectful and professional whenever they interact with the test subjects. It is also important that examiners treat the information that test subjects share in a way that adheres to the consent form they signed. It is also important that the correct test procedure is followed, especially that the pre and post test questionnaires are completed at the correct times.</p>
         <b>What should the examiners avoid telling the test subjects?</b>
         <p>The examiners should not provide helpful hints when they see that the test subject is a bit confused, it is important that the test subjects try to work out how to fix the confusion alone before providing aid. It is also important that examiners remain impartial towards the product, their personal feelings about it should not be shared with subjects before or during the tests.</p>
         <b>What/how/when should the examiners measure?</b>
         <p>The examiners should measure success as test subjects completing the usability goals, this can be done throughout the test. The examiner who is taking notes on the test should fill in the data collection sheet to help with measurement.</p>
         <br>
         <center><font size="4"><b>Reporting</b></font></center>
         <p>With permission from the test subject, a video of the test session should be taken, or an audio recording if video is not possible. Notes should be taken as well, in case the examiner notices something at the time that might be missed in the video. The main points to notice for this section are: the steps that the user had difficulty with, any components that they particularly liked or disliked, and features or functionality that is missing.</p> 

         <p>The first step for the test documentation process is filling in the pre-test questionnaire. The next piece of documentation material is the data collection sheet, this should be used by the examiner in charge of taking notes on the test. The post-test questionnaire should be completed at the end of the test. If there are additional commenents that are not reflected in the video/audio recording and the data collection sheet, a short decription can be used to summarize these points. </p>
