         <p> Through our testing, we were able to discern several areas with room for improvement. These suggestions are outlined below: <p> <br>

         	<p>1. The Design<p>

         	<p>Something all three of our testers commented on was the user interface of the program. There was initially confusion over the background, as the testers believed that is was part of the program, rather than the background of the actual phone. After that was clarified for them, they suggested several improvements. One suggestion was that the analog clock displayed be changed to a digital one. Our team agrees with this suggestion, as a lot of younger people now are growing up with purely digital clocks, so this alteration may make the program accessible to a wider audience.<p>

         	<p> Another suggestion was to make the writing on the home page larger, or make it a different colour. One of our testers wore glasses, but found it difficult to see and understand where she should be writing on the home page.<p>

         	<p>2. Help Documentation<p>

         	<p> When our testers were asked whether they felt they had support using the system, they all answered not at all. They explained this by saying that it was unclear what they were meant to be doing on the home page, and if they had run into issues, there was no documentation they could turn to. For example, one of our testers noticed that, if they entered a space after the name of an app they were looking for, the search function wouldn't work. The space had to be removed in order for them to continue. Documentation specify how to phrase a search could have been helpful in this situation. Our team thinks it could be very beneficial to include instructions and an area where users could refer to if there is a problem while they use the app.<p>

         	<p>3. App Accessability<p>

         	<p>Two of our testers pointed out that having to manually write in the name of the application they wanted to access would be difficult the more apps they had on their phone. Unless they had very good memories, they would just forget what other programs were available to them. Our team suggests that possibly applications could be
