         <p>For this deliverable, we were tasked with evaluating group BKC.<p>
         <p><center><font size="4"><b>Testing</b></font></center></p>
         <p>User testing was conducted with 3 test subjects that we deemed fit for the user population described in BKC's description. The tests were done on Android and conducted as described in the BKC test script. The results can be seen <a href="./Documents/Hi-Fi_Prototype_Usability_Test_Report.pdf">here</a>.

         <p><b>User Manual</b></p>

         <p>The user manual provided was very thorough and was useful for testing. However, one issue that we came across was in the method for creating an Android emulator, there were no instructions to then allow that emulated device to access the host WiFi. This was a necessary step so it would have been useful to have documentation. The prototype also did not function on the enumlated Android device, despite following the steps laid out in the manual.</p> <br>

         <p><b>Usability Goals</b></p>

         <p><u>Comments for the usability goals are under each provided goal in bold.</u></p>

         <p>Achieve goals in a timely manner</p>
         <p>Rationale for goal: During our prototype testing, users informed us that the core functionality they wanted from their phones was to access the application they wanted as quickly as possible. <p>
         <p>How we'll measure meeting this goal: In order to gauge the completion of this goal, examiners will time how long it takes for test subjects to go from the command prompt to the application they have been directed to access. </p>

         <p><b>We believe this goal was a useful one to include because it gives a clear idea of the time taken, however, it didn't take into account the differing use speeds that users may have and the fact that some users lack familiarity with an android operating system.</b></p> <br>

         <p>Achieve goals with little to no resistance (number of tasks)</p>
         <p>Rationale for goal: One of our principal motivations for the design of our application was that users should be less distracted when trying to achieve a particular goal. </p>
         <p>How we'll measure meeting this goal: Evaluators will count the number of separate tasks</p>

         <p><b>This goal was a litte vauge to be able to evaluate, especially considering that the numbers of tasks was provided in the testing plan. This could be more easy measured in an open ended test or an observation of a user where set tasks are not provided.</b></p> <br>

         <p>Transitions from one activity to another should be seamless (time) </p>
         <p>Rationale for goal: One of our principal motivations for the design of our application was that users should be less distracted when trying to achieve a particular goal. </p>
         <p>How we'll measure meeting this goal: Evaluators will measure the time it takes to go from one task to another. </p>

         <p><b>This goal is a repeat of the first goal, so does not evaluate any new charateristics of the system. </b></p> <br>


         <p><b>Test Procedure and Reporting</b></p>
         <p>The test procedure was easy to understand, however, we were unsure as to what exactly the timer was needed for because it was not mentioned elsewhere. It would have been useful to have been provided with a structed document that we could fill in for observations, instead of the free form document that was provided.</p>
         <p>We were also expecting to be provided with material such as a pre and post-test questionnaire and a formal user intruction. This meant that we were unsure of what exactly the user was supposed to know about the application before beginning testing. This was also difficult because a short description of the project could only be found in the project proposal, and we were unsure in many manjor changes had been made since then so could not use it as a description.</p>

         <p><b>Usability Evaluation</b></p>
         <p>The usability evaluation section actually included a test script which was useful but should have been included in the reporting section. There was also a note at the top of the instructions that said all items in bold are mandatory and must be asked, however, only one line was in bold, which lead to some confusion about what was mandatory and what was bonus information.</p> 
         <p>The section was missing any mention of specific heuristics from Nielsen's list. It also did not have any justificiation for the selected testing goals.</p>
         <br>

         <p><center><font size="4"><b>Design Critique</b></font></center><p> 
         <p> Through our testing, we were able to discern several areas with room for improvement. These suggestions are outlined below: <p> 

         	<p><b>1. The Design</b></p>

         	<p>Something all three of our testers commented on was the user interface of the program. There was initially confusion over the background, as the testers believed that is was part of the program, rather than the background of the actual phone. After that was clarified for them, they suggested several improvements. One suggestion was that the analog clock displayed be changed to a digital one. Our team agrees with this suggestion, as a lot of younger people now are growing up with purely digital clocks, so this alteration may make the program accessible to a wider audience.</p>

         	<p>Another suggestion was to make the writing on the home page larger, or make it a different colour. One of our testers wore glasses, but found it difficult to see and understand where she should be writing on the home page.</p>

         	<p><b>2. Help Documentation</b></p>

         	<p> When our testers were asked whether they felt they had support using the system, they all answered not at all. They explained this by saying that it was unclear what they were meant to be doing on the home page, and if they had run into issues, there was no documentation they could turn to. For example, one of our testers noticed that, if they entered a space after the name of an app they were looking for, the search function wouldn't work. The space had to be removed in order for them to continue. Documentation specify how to phrase a search could have been helpful in this situation. Our team thinks it could be very beneficial to include instructions and an area where users could refer to if there is a problem while they use the app.</p>

         	<p><b>3. App Accessability</b></p>

         	<p>Two of our testers pointed out that having to manually write in the name of the application they wanted to access would be difficult the more apps they had on their phone. Unless they had very good memories, they would just forget what other programs were available to them. When looking through the User Manual, we saw that there is a function that allows seeing the active applications, however, no testers noticed this feature. Our team suggests making this possibility much more visible. Another option we came up with was that possibly applications could be grouped by category. For example, when a user wants to watch movies, they can just type in, "Movie," and different applications will come up (Netflix, Youtube, Amazon Prime Videos etc.)<p>

            <p><b>4. Fluidity</b></p>

            <p>Several of the testers said that due to the tedious task of entering what app they want to access each time, they probably wouldn't use the product for very long. A possible improvememt would be to use something similar to tabs on a Chrome browser, so it is easier and more fluid to navigate between applications.</p> <br>
