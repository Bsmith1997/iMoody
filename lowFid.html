            <b>1. The registration process should be fast and easy:</b> The registration process for iMoody should take the user less than a minute. The system does not require a large amount of personal information, simply the name, and email address of the user as well as their interests so the recommendations are tailored well. This means it is fast to fill out in most cases.<br><br>
            <b>2. The system should be convenient to use:</b> The goal of iMoody is to be as non-intrusive as possible so as not to annoy users. We want iMoody to help the user learn new habits in terms of how they use social media, not annoy them so much that they ignore or delete the plugin. Therefore, the pop-up will only appear when user input is needed and can be found easily in the navigation bar.<br><br>
            <b>3. Rating mood should be done very quickly:</b> The user's most interaction with the iMoody will come in the form of the mood rating pop up. Because of this it is something that should be very fast so as not to take up the user's time. Users should be able to rate their mood within 15 seconds.<br><br>
            <b>4. The system should not hinder the user’s normal activities:</b> The iMoody system is not designed to cut the user off from using social media or limit the use of it. The point is to use cognitive behavioural therapy to help the user learn heathier habits in relation to social media. This means that the user can continue with their normal habits without interference from the pop up.<br><br>
            <b>5. The system’s interface should be simple to understand: </b> The system is designed to have a low learning curve so as to appeal to as many people as possible. New learners should not have significant difficulty getting to know the system especially as there are not many different windows to interact with.<br><br>
            <b>6. The system should help the user reduce the time spent on social media: </b> The system is designed to show the user the negative effect that excessive social media use has on their mood and give them tools to combat that. Because of this, iMoody should, over time, teach the user to spend more time off social media.<br><br>
            <b>7. The system should provide a visual representation for users to see how social media alters their mood: </b>An important part of the cognitive therapy approach that we are applying is being to show the user the results that their social media use has on their mood. This means that users should be able to access an easy to interpret visual representation of how their mood is affected by their usage.  <br><br>
