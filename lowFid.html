        <p><center><font size="4"><b>Usability Goals and Benchmark Tasks</b></font></center></p> 
        <p> <font size="3"><u><b>Usability Goals</b></u></font> <br>
            <b>1. The registration process should be fast and easy:</b> The registration process for iMoody should take the user less than a minute. The system does not require a large amount of personal information, simply the name, and email address of the user as well as their interests so the recommendations are tailored well. This means it is fast to fill out in most cases.<br><br>
            <b>2. The system should be convenient to use:</b> The goal of iMoody is to be as non-intrusive as possible so as not to annoy users. We want iMoody to help the user learn new habits in terms of how they use social media, not annoy them so much that they ignore or delete the plugin. Therefore, the pop-up will only appear when user input is needed and can be found easily in the navigation bar.<br><br>
            <b>3. Rating mood should be done very quickly:</b> The user's most interaction with the iMoody will come in the form of the mood rating pop up. Because of this it is something that should be very fast so as not to take up the user's time. Users should be able to rate their mood within 15 seconds.<br><br>
            <b>4. The system should not hinder the userâs normal activities:</b> The iMoody system is not designed to cut the user off from using social media or limit the use of it. The point is to use cognitive behavioural therapy to help the user learn heathier habits in relation to social media. This means that the user can continue with their normal habits without interference from the pop up.<br><br>
            <b>5. The systemâs interface should be simple to understand: </b> The system is designed to have a low learning curve so as to appeal to as many people as possible. New learners should not have significant difficulty getting to know the system especially as there are not many different windows to interact with.<br><br>
            <b>6. The system should help the user reduce the time spent on social media: </b> The system is designed to show the user the negative effect that excessive social media use has on their mood and give them tools to combat that. Because of this, iMoody should, over time, teach the user to spend more time off social media.<br><br>
            <b>7. The system should provide a visual representation for users to see how social media alters their mood: </b>An important part of the cognitive therapy approach that we are applying is being to show the user the results that their social media use has on their mood. This means that users should be able to access an easy to interpret visual representation of how their mood is affected by their usage.  <br><br>

          <p> <font size="3"><u><b>Observer Briefing</b></u></font> <br>
          <p> We decided that it was not relevant to include an Observer briefing as part of our test documentation because our tests were performed without a person in the observer role. In one test, one team member manipulated the prototypes and another other team member asked the questions and filmed it. In the second test, one team member manipulated the protypes and asked questions, while recording the audio. The final test was not recorded, however, the team member took thorough notes during testing. </p><br>

        <p><b>Prototype 1</b></p>
        <p><u>Create an Account</u></p>
        <p>This test was easy to understand for the tester, the prototype was clear and it was achieved quickly.</p>
        <p><u>Log in to the account</u></p>
        <p>The ability to do this was ommited from this prototype due to a design oversight.</p>
        <p><u>Rate your mood</u></p>
        <p>The tester had no trouble with this step and easily rated her mood.</p>
        <p><u>Add a custom activity selection</u></p>
        <p>The tester was able to add a custom activity selection in the sign up from at the beginning and was satisfied with this. </p>
        <p><u>View mood statistics</u></p>
        <p>The tester was able to find the mood statistics easily but wanted a bit more detail in the statistics themselves and perhaps different ways to view the statistics so as to better understand them. </p>
        <p><u>Choose an activity</u></p>
        <p> In this prototype the system recommends an activity in a specific activity category instead of offering suggestions from various categories, which our tester enjoyed but she did express an interest in having recommendations from various categories available. </p>
        <p><u>Log out</u></p>
        <p>Again, this was ommitted from this prototype so the tester was not able to complete this step.</p><br>

        <p><b>Prototype 2</b></p>
        <p><u>Create an Account</u></p>
        <p>The tester thought that this screen was very straightforward, they were able to complete it quickly and were confident it worked</p>
        <p><u>Log in to the account</u></p>
        <p>There was no functionality in this prototype to complete this step.</p>
        <p><u>Rate your mood</u></p>
        <p>The tester enjoyed the amount of selection there was for mood rating and thought all the options made sense</p>
        <p><u>Add a custom activity selection</u></p>
        <p>There was no functionality for this test so the tester could not complete this.</p>
        <p><u>View mood statistics</u></p>
        <p>The tester was not sure how to navigate to this page initially. After working that out, he did not really understand the way the data was presented and said he did not think it would help him work out how his mood was impacted.</p>
        <p><u>Choose an activity</u></p>
        <p>The tester did not understand this section of the prototype at all, he thought that it was there to help filter the posts that he saw on facebook to only things in the section of interest. Once he realized what it was for, he liked the suggestions that were given. </p>
        <p><u>Log out</u></p>
        <p>This funtionality was not represented in this prototype.</p> <br>

        <p><b>Prototype 3</b></p><br>
        <p><u>Create an Account</u></p><br>
        <p>Some issue with the the arrows for indiciating moving forward or going back, need to be made more clear.</p>

        <p>Successful.</p>
        <p><u>Add a custom activity selection</u></p><br>
        <p>Was confused with the next key to press after choosing a mood (chose log out button instead of the button to continue).</p>
        <p><u>View mood statistics</u></p><br>
        <p>Successful, but one tester had an issue with how we were showing the results, might have to think of different ways to show the results in a better way.</p>
        <p><u>Choose an activity</u></p><br>
        <p>Successful.</p>
        <p><u>Log out</u></p><br>
       	<p>Successful, might have to change the design of the log out button though because it is too similar to a continue button.</p>

        <p><u>Possible changes</u></p><br>
        <p>1. Consider changing the choices of icons used on some of the protypes, testers were particularly confused by the light bulb in protype 2 that was intended to represent recommendations. It was interpreted as an exclamtion mark which testers though meant it was an alerts window.

        <p>2. Some issues regarding the usability of prototype 3 included what would happen if a user forgot his or her password, having to log in multiple times if entering social media websites, and the logout button being unclearly identified. User interface for a forgotten password will have to be added and the logout button will either have to say explicitly log out or be shown in a different context (perhaps shown as a power button instead of an arrow). Also one of the testers brought up the idea of notifying the user if the user accepted an activity and logged back onto facebook. A lot of these ideas will be implemented in up and coming designs. </p>
