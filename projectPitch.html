        <p>We were interested in the cognitive behavioural therapy that was mentioned during brainstorming so researched some techniques that are used when applying CBT. This lead us to the project idea of a website or browser plugin that users can apply as a Cognitive Restructuring Technique. They will use it to firstly log their mood before they open an application (such as Instagram or Facebook, which are shown to lower mood and self esteem), by using a simple rating. After using the application, they will then be prompted to rate their mood again. We will then compile this data to help the user see how social media affects their mood.</p>

        We  think this might be useful to allow users to see the effect that technology, and specifically the more addictive social media platforms, have on their lives and might encourage them to cut back on the use.
